# Project Pitch

In this assignment, you'll refine the idea for your project. In contrast to the
previous projects ideas you described, the project you describe in this
assignment should be the one you plan to do. This is your chance to lay out some
of your initial ideas, based on the feedback and thoughts you've had since the
previous project ideas. Because you're describing only one project this week, be
sure to take extra time to describe it well! Your goal should be to specify your
current thoughts about the project, your current unknowns, and your sense of how
suitable the project is for this course. Provide enough detail so that I and
others in the class can give you helpful feedback. Aim for clarity; if you're
not clear about something, say so! 

Write your pitch by filling in (and expanding on) the prompts in `pitch.md`. 
You'll notice that this file is quite similar (but not entirely the same) as the
one you filled out for your project ideas. You can copy / paste some of your
material from a project idea, if there's some overlap. But be sure to also
address the comments of anyone else (e.g., grutor, classmates, me etc.), which
may have come up in the best few weeks

**Additionally, be prepared to talk about your project in class on Monday,
October 24.** There's nothing extra to prepare for this discussion (other than
doing this assignment); but be prepared to discuss. The goal for Monday's class
will be to feel confident about your project, thanks to the work you've done
for this assignment and the feedback you'll get in class.

**Note:** If you plan to work with someone on the project, that's great! 
For this assignment, though, each of you should write up your own, independent 
pitch. Please let me know, in the project description, if you'd like to work
with someone else on the project. 

## Grading
Good responses (i.e., responses that receive a 3) will:

   + fully respond to every prompt in the starter file, _and_
   + be well-written and easy to read, i.e., clear yet concise using good 
   spelling, grammar, organization, and proper formatting, to convey a 
   well-formed idea, _and_
   + where appropriate, support your thoughts with references to material from
   class, from the domain of your project, or from other solutions in the same
   domain.

Great responses (i.e., responses that receive a 4) will additionally:

   + be particularly insightful about the needs of the user and about the
   suitability of the idea as a CS 111 project ("insightful" means that you've
   clearly articulated all the angles, the benefits and drawbacks, risks, etc.),
   + be particularly clear about the challenges of the project and your 
   current open questions about the project
   + provide some initial, well-reasoned speculation about how the
   implementation will proceed, including: what you plan to work on first,
   whether the project might work best as an internal or external language,
   candidates for potential host languages, etc.

## Critiques

After the submission deadline, I'll assign critique teams. 
**Update:** [Here are the teams](https://github.com/hmc-cs111-fall2016/project-pitch/wiki/Teams)
You'll meet in the teams during Monday's class, where you'll generate some material for your first
critique. The critique will then be due Tuesday night.

Here are some suggestions for critiques:

   + What do you like about their idea?
   + Was there a need that was similar to one you thought of? If so, how are
   your thoughts about the problems similar to and different from your partners?   
   + Do you know anything about this domain? Do you know of existing DSLs that
   they didn't mention or do you have some expertise thinking about or writing
   programs for this domain? How might your experience augment your partner's
   thoughts on the domain?
   + Answer the questions about suitability, scope, etc. of the project.
   + What's not clear about the project?

## Tasks
- [ ] Write responses in the file `pitch.md`.
- [ ] Submit your work.
- [ ] Comment on your critique partners' work.
