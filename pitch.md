# Sight Reading for All

## Describe your project in five words
Automatic Sight Reading Material Generation

## Audience
_Who are you helping, with your language? What is that person's
experience like now? How would their experience be better if you could help 
them?_

The target audience is musicians of all levels. Currently, it is fairly difficult
to improve one's sight reading bec

## Why a language?
_Why is a **DSL** appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_


## Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_


## Interface (syntax)
_What kinds of things can the user say in your language. How, generally, do they
say it? **Be as specific as possible.** You don't need to design syntax; but you
should be more specific than "The user describes properties of unicorns.", e.g.,
by describing which unicorn properties (horn color, tattoo, etc.) are most 
important to users and what kinds of values those properties might have._ 


## Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? Is there a computational model that
corresponds with your domain? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of semantic (i.e., non-syntax) errors might occur, and how 
might they be communicated to the user?_


## Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


## Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## Suitability
_What percentage of your time do you think will be spent directly engaging in
the **language** aspects of this project (e.g., making language design
decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the project (e.g., implementing a
complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot of language design)?_


## Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


## Challenges and opportunities
_Why is this a good project? What are some challenges you expect to face? How
might you overcome them? What are some warning signs that the project has gotten
off track, and how will you get the project back on track if needed?_
